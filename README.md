My name is Ndumbi Kimani, and I am a data scientist. 

This dashboard presents my first Dashboard Project for Sterling E-Commerce. 
The project is aimed at optimizing operational workflows and extracting meaningful insights through comprehensive data analysis, 
enabling informed and strategic decision-making.

The project includes several key steps: data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, advanced data analysis to uncover patterns
and trends, and data visualization using an Excel dashboard to communicate the findings clearly and effectively.

Below, you will also find a PowerPoint presentation that further illustrates and presents the same data in a structured and visually 
engaging format.
